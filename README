The Makefile is in src. A helper script called 'build' has
been written to assist in interacting with the Makefile in
the project root directory. It's very simple. Anybody familiar
with shell syntax should have no problem deciphering it.

The executable ircd-micro will be created in src. To install,
place it somewhere in your $PATH. It is mostly standalone,
however it needs to know where to find the relevant config
files. It first looks for them in the directory called 'etc',
relative to the current working directory. If the files are
somewhere else, you may specify their location with the
appropriate options. Invoke ircd-micro with -h to get a list
of options.
