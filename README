ABOUT
  ircd-micro is an attempt to write an IRC daemon from scratch for the 4.3
  BSD architecture. This was done more as a personal challenge rather than
  as a real practical project.

  The goal is to be fully compatible with most modern TS6 IRC daemons, in
  particular charybdis ircd and atheme-services. This will allow a 4.3 BSD
  system running ircd-micro to be linked into existing TS6 networks.


CONTACT
  The official ircd-micro channel is #micro on irc.interlinked.me. I will
  be using one of many nicknames, but will definitely have +o. Users
  with +o are contributors.


COMPILING
  The Makefile is in src. A helper script called 'build' has been written to
  assist in interacting with the Makefile in the project root directory. It's
  very simple. Anybody familiar with shell syntax should have no problem
  deciphering it.

  The executable ircd-micro will be created in src. To install, place it
  somewhere in your $PATH. It is mostly standalone, however it needs to know
  where to find the relevant config files. It first looks for them in the
  directory called 'etc', relative to the current working directory. If
  the files are somewhere else, you may specify their location with the
  appropriate options. Invoke ircd-micro with -h to get a list of options.


RUNNING
  Configuration goes in etc/micro.conf. An example configuration file
  can be found in doc/micro.conf.example
